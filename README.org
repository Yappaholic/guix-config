#+description: Personal configuration files for GNU Guix System



This repository has my personal config for using Guix System/OS, which is configured in Guile Scheme language and has a lot of similarities to the Nix/NixOS configuration system.

** Currently this configuration has and supports:

- Latest xkb layouts and variants with xkeyboard-config@2.44
- Transform utilities for using xkeyboard-config@2.44 and nvidia-drivers
- Home manager with pipewire service and fish integration (kind of)
- Package definition for [[https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/maomaowm.git][Maomao Window Manager]]
- Package definition for Neovim 0.11.1
- Package definition for [[https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty][Ghostty terminal]] (WIP)

This list is not finished, maybe I'll even create Guix channel for keeping all the packages in the future.

** How to use this config

You shouldn't. This config is an example of configuration, that you might want to use as a reference at most. For packages, you can copy their definitions and then use them in your config like this:

#+begin_src scheme
(use-modules (path to module file))
;; Your config starts here
;; like using timezone, hostname, bla-bla-bla...
(operating-system
 ;; Add packages from custom module file
 (packages
  (list
   foo-package))
;; Your config continues here
...)
#+end_src

Then, to update your system with the new package, use this command:

#+begin_src bash
sudo -E guix system -L path/to/custom/packages reconfigure path/to/system/config/file
#+end_src

Or, you can optionally install a package from the command line:

#+begin_src bash
guix package --install -f path/to/custom/package/file
#+end_src
